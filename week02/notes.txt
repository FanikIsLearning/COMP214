Why do we need primary key?
first normal form

What is normal form?
The normal forms (from least normalized to most normalized) are:
UNF: Unnormalized form.
1NF: First normal form.
2NF: Second normal form.
3NF: Third normal form.
EKNF: Elementary key normal form.
BCNF: Boyce–Codd normal form.
4NF: Fourth normal form.
ETNF: Essential tuple normal form.

Object Sequence
- Oracle is serial database, sequence is importance
- 
1. outer generate it; 
2. design the system 
3. unique identification e.g. driving license, passport

Sequence
starting from increment
[max/min]
[cycle/crash]

INSERT AND B() 
(Seq Primary key... NEXTVAL)

When will be primary id duplicated?
CURRVAL (orderitems is another unique key)

2 Categories
- 1. Simple view - 1 table/no queries (DML Data Manipulation Language)
- 2. Complex view - key-preserved GROUPBY / DISTINCT / ROWNUM / Blocking users/ Limiting users to access
- 3. In-line view - temporary table - top
- 4. Materialized view snapshot - stores - keep taking screen shot and instant saving, e.g. comparing between days data

Two pseudocolumns NEXTVAL and CURRVAL
Pseudocolumns are data associated with table data, much like columns, but aren’t physical columns stored in the database.
NEXTVAL (NEXT VALUE) is used to actually generate the sequence value. (sequence object and requests the value of the next number in the sequence)
CURRVAL (CURRENT VALUE) pseudocolumn

Chapter Summary
• A sequence can be created to generate a series of integers.
• The values generated by a sequence can be stored in any table.
• A sequence is created with the CREATE SEQUENCE command.
• Gaps in sequences might occur if the values are stored in various tables, if
numbers are cached but not used, or if a rollback occurs.
• A value is generated by using the NEXTVAL pseudocolumn.
• The CURRVAL pseudocolumn is NULL until a value is generated by NEXTVAL.
• The USER_OBJECTS data dictionary object can be used to confirm the existence
of all schema objects.
• The USER_SEQUENCES data dictionary object is used to view sequence
settings.
• A sequence value may be set as the DEFAULT value for a column.
• The ALTER SEQUENCE command is used to modify an existing sequence.
The only settings that can’t be modified are the START WITH option and any
option that would be invalid because of previously generated values.
• The DUAL table is helpful for testing sequence value generation.
• The DROP SEQUENCE command deletes an existing sequence.
• An Identity Column may be defined to manage a primary key column.
• An index can be created to speed up the query process.
• DML operations are always slower when indexes exist.
• Oracle 12c creates an index for PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints
automatically.
• An explicit index is created with the CREATE INDEX command.
• An index can be used by Oracle 12c automatically if a query criterion or sort
operation is based on a column or an expression used to create the index.
• The two main structures for indexes are B-tree and bitmap.
• The explain plan can verify whether an index is used in a query.
• Function-based indexes are used to index an expression or the use of functions
on a column or columns.
• An index organized table is a table stored in a B-tree structure to combine the
index and table into one database object.
• Information about an index can be retrieved from the USER_INDEXES and
USER_IND_COLUMNS views.
• An index can be dropped with the DROP INDEX command.
• An index can be renamed with the ALTER INDEX command.
• Except for a name change, an index can’t be modified. It must be deleted and
then re-created.
• A synonym provides a permanent alias for a database object.
• A public synonym is available to any database user.
• A private synonym is available only to the user who created it.
• A synonym is created by using the CREATE SYNONYM command.
• A synonym is deleted by using the DROP SYNONYM command.
• Only a user with DBA privileges can drop a public synonym.

_________________________________________________________________
• A view is a temporary or virtual table used to retrieve data stored in underlying
database tables.
• The view query must be executed each time the view is used.
• A view can be used to simplify queries or restrict access to sensitive data.
• A view is created with the CREATE VIEW command.
• A view can’t be modified. To change a view, it must be dropped and then
re-created, or the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW command must be used.
• Any DML operation can be performed on a simple query if it doesn’t violate a
constraint.
• A view containing expressions or functions or joining multiple tables is considered
a complex view.
• A complex view can be used to update only one table. The table must be a keypreserved
table.
• Data can’t be added to a view column containing an expression.
• DML operations aren’t permitted on non-key-preserved tables.
• DML operations aren’t permitted on views that include group functions, a GROUP
BY clause, the ROWNUM pseudocolumn, or the DISTINCT keyword.
• Oracle 12c assigns a row number to every row in a table to indicate its
position in the table. The row number can be referenced by the keyword
ROWNUM.
• A view can be dropped with the DROP VIEW command. The data isn’t affected
because it exists in the original tables.
• An inline view can be used only by the current statement and can include an
ORDER BY clause.
• CROSS and OUTER APPLY methods allow inline views in the FROM clause to
reference columns from other tables in the query.
• TOP-N analysis uses the ROWNUM of sorted data to determine a range of top
values.
• Using a row_limiting_clause at the end of a query simplifies TOP-N analysis with
fetch and skip options to define the rows to be returned.
• Materialized views physically store view query results.
